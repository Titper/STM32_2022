# STM32_2022_14

STM32 CubeIDE used : V1.8.0  

### Temperature & Humidy sensor DHT22

Brendan ROBIN : Set the LCD screen and SHT31 together with the microcontroller STM32L476  
  
- LCD alone with STM32L476 : done  (28/01/2022)  
- DHT22 & LCD with STM32L476 : done (06/01/2022)    

### Temperature & Humidity sensor SHT31

Marine MARRAGOU : Set the LCD screen and SHT31 together with the microcontroller STM32L476  

- LCD alone with STM32L476 : done  (28/01/2022)  
- STH31 & LCD with STM31L476 : done (08/01/2022)  

### Elevator project   

Including : 

- DHT22 (OneWire)  
- Grove Digital Light Sensor V1.0 (I2C)  
- 2x STM32L476  
- 2x Digilent PMod (SPI & Wifi)
- Grove LCD RGB Backlight V4.0 (I2C)  
            
Project : 

- Create a weather station in a building's elevator  
- Will be able to show outside weather (humidity, temperature and light) on a LCD display in the elevator thanks to Wifi connection between an outside STM32 and the elevator's STM32
